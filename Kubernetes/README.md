# Kubernetes

Kubernetes(K8s) is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications in different kind of environments such as physical, virtual, and cloud infrastructure.. The components that make up Kubernetes are designed to be loosely coupled and extensible to meet a wide variety of different workloads. This extensibility is provided in large part by the Kubernetes API, which is used by internal components as well as extensions and containers running on Kubernetes.

Purpose of this repository is to explore Kubernetes with help of examples.
