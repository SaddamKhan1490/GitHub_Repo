# GraphQL

GraphQL is a data query language developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before being publicly released in 2015. It's an alternative to REST and ad-hoc web service architectures.

GraphQL allows clients to define the structure of the data required, and exactly the same structure of the data is returned from the server. It is a strongly typed runtime which allows clients to dictate what data is needed, therefore preventing excessively large amounts of data being returned.

GraphQL servers are available for multiple languages : Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, C#, Scala, Go, Elixir, Erlang, PHP, and Clojure.

Purpose of this repository is to explore GraphQL as substitute for RESTful web_services via examples.
