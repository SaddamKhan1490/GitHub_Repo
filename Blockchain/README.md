# Blockchain

A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block typically contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp, and transaction data. By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way". For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority.

Blockchains are secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high fault tolerance. Decentralized consensus has therefore been achieved with a blockchain.This makes blockchains potentially suitable for the recording of events, bank tarnsactions and payments, medical records, and other records management activities, such as identity management, transaction processing, documenting provenance, food traceability, and voting.

Purpose of this repository is to explore various nuances of blockchain with help of examples.
