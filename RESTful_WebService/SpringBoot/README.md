# SpringBoot Overview

Spring Boot = Spring + BootStrape Server

Spring Boot is built on top of Spring Framework which is used to create Enterprise Java Application and is build on top of JAVA

SpringBoot comes with inbuilt Server i.e. Standalone and requires No external Server or Servlet Containers in order to execute application, so it helps in building easy to start productionized Spring Applications, so that we can create standalone production grade application and just run the Spring Application

Spring allows us to focus only the business Logic or use case i.e. create service or dao connection and rest all, configuration and othre required details it will take care itself i.e. we need to only specify the annotation and let spring do all necessary configuration

Spring Boot is opinionated (i.e. additional set of Maven dependencies apart from Spring to make it as SpringBoot)and prefers convention over configuration

Spring Boot has proven great deal in configuring the and creating Micro Services

# This repository will be used for creating RESTful Web Services applications using Spring Boot
