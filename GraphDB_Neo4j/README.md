# Neo4j

Neo4j is a graph database management system developed by Neo4j, Inc. Described by its developers as an ACID-compliant transactional database with native graph storage and processing. It's highly scalable in nature and is schema free (NoSQL).

In Neo4j, everything is stored in the form of either an edge, a node, or an attribute. Each node and edge can have any number of attributes. Both the nodes and edges can be labelled and these labels can be used to narrow searches. 

Neo4j is implemented in Java and accessible using Cypher Query Language through a transactional HTTP endpoint, or through the binary bolt protocol.

Purpose of this repository is to explore Neo4j with help of examples.
