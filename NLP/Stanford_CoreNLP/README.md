# Stanford CoreNLP 

Stanford CoreNLP is speech or text processing library developed by Stanford to give the base forms of words, their parts of speech, whether they are names of companies, people, etc., normalize dates, times, and numeric quantities, mark up the structure of sentences in terms of phrases and syntactic dependencies, indicate which noun phrases refer to the same entities, indicate sentiment, extract particular or open-class relations between entity mentions, get the quotes people said, etc.

Stanford CoreNLP integrates many of Stanford’s NLP tools, including the part-of-speech (POS) tagger, the named entity recognizer (NER), the parser, the coreference resolution system, sentiment analysis, bootstrapped pattern learning, and the open information extraction tools.

Stanford CoreNLP’s goal is to make it very easy to apply a bunch of linguistic analysis tools on a piece of text. A tool pipeline can run on a piece of plain text with just two lines of code. Here we will try to explore Stanford CoreNLP with help of examples.
